# Python_Apple-aap
Python-based Apple Accessory Protocol for communicating to iPods and other Apple devices

This project was initially created for the purposes of eventually creating an Android emulator layer to speak AAP protocol to interface with car headunits that only support Apple devices.

UPDATE 1/25/2020 11:58 UTC: State of code is unknown. Browsing through the code it appears, at the very least, the base framework of attempting to interact with the Apple device is in-place. It is, however, likely that debugging needs to occur to test (or fix) the ability to successfully communicate to Apple devices.
